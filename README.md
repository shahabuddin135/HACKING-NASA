# HACKING-NASA

This project is a hacking simulation program created by Shahabuddin. It mimics large data fetches, prints multiple lines of unintelligible sentences, simulates failed data retrieval attempts, and retries until success. Additionally, it features an end function to simulate erasing digital footprints and securing the system.

Features
Generates random data lines with hacking-related terms.
Simulates data fetching with a random success/failure mechanism.
Retries data fetching until successful.
Erases digital footprints and secures the system upon completion.
Colorful console outputs using Chalk for better visual distinction.
Interactive user prompts with Inquirer.
Animated loading spinners with Ora.
Technologies Used
TypeScript: For type-safe JavaScript development.
Inquirer: To create interactive command-line interfaces.
Chalk: To style terminal strings and add colors.
Ora: To display elegant loading spinners.
