# HACKING-NASA
This project is a hacking simulation program created by Shahabuddin. It mimics large data fetches, prints multiple lines of unintelligible sentences, simulates failed data retrieval attempts, and retries until success. Additionally, it features an end function to simulate erasing digital footprints and securing the system.
